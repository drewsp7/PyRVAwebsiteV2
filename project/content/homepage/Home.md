# Welcome to PyRVA

The Python language is a rarity in the software industry: accessible to almost everyone, versatile across application domains and generally a joy to work with. While enjoying Python alone is beneficial, PyRVA believes that Python is best enjoyed in the company of others. We are busy organizing talks, hackathons, workshops and more to help build up the Python community here in Richmond. Ideas are welcome.

PyRVA Meets twice a month. Feel free to come early and ask questions or just hang out. After each meeting, we will generally hang out for a bit and can also answer any questions at that time.

Lecture Night: 2nd Wednesday of the month
We bring speakers in from around the country to teach us something new about Python. You'll be able to ask the speaker(s) any questions you have on the topic.
